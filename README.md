# Visualizing Earthquakes with Keen IO and matplotlib!

I've been collecting [earthquakes](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/) from the [USGS](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/)
for the past few months and storing them in a Keen IO project. I've released the project id
and read key for the project so everyone can play with earthquake data with Keen IO!

At Keen IO, we often use our own product to check our business, performance, and usage stats. I often
need to prototype visualizations for my team's projects.
I love using Python tools such as [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/), [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/),
Pandas, and the [Keen IO python library](https://github.com/keenlabs/KeenClient-Python) to help me run these tasks.
These tools let me run and visualize queries quickly. It's also an easy way to share data with my teammates.

I hope you get some use out of my example code! Please feel free to fork this project and play around with the data!
